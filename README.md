#  Student Performance Analysis & Insights

**Objective:**  
Analyze and visualize how study habits, attendance, lifestyle, and demographics influence student exam performance using Python.

---

## **Project Overview**
This project explores a dataset of 1000 students with 16 features, focusing on `exam_score` as the target variable.  
We perform **EDA, feature engineering, and hypothesis testing (T-test, ANOVA)** to extract actionable insights.

---

## **Dataset**
- **Source:** [Student Performance Dataset (Kaggle)](https://github.com/bhshre/Student-Performance-Analysis/blob/main/data/student_performance_data.csv)
- **Size:** 1000 rows × 16 columns
- **Key Columns:**  
  - `exam_score`, `study_hours`, `sleep_hours`, `gender`, `diet_quality`, `internet_quality`, `social_media_hours`

## **Notebook**
- **Google Colab Notebook:** [View Analysis Here](https://github.com/bhshre/Student-Performance-Analysis/blob/main/notebooks/Student_performance_analysis.ipynb)  
  

---

## **Key Insights**
- **Study Hours & Study Efficiency:** Strong positive correlation with exam scores.  
- **Sleep Patterns:** 6–8 hours of sleep leads to higher and more consistent performance.  
- **Digital Distractions:** Netflix & social media time negatively impact scores.  
- **Gender & Diet Quality:** No statistically significant difference in scores (T-test & ANOVA).  
- **Part-Time Job:** No noticeable impact on exam performance.

## **Conclusion**
Academic success in this dataset is **more influenced by study habits, balanced sleep, and reduced digital distractions** than by demographic or lifestyle factors like gender or diet.  
Statistical tests confirm that gender and diet do not significantly affect performance, while **dedicated study time and effective time management are key drivers of success.**
